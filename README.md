# TopicSearch
Learning .NET core API with elastic search deployment on docker and Kubernetes
Orchestration of multiple services from one deployment with network bridge


#Prerequisite
This application is just a learning to integrate elastic search with .net Core 6.0 and building an API to store Topic Data and User Data. You need to have docker or podmon installed in your computer as linux containers.

#Docker Commands

There is 2 docker compose file created to run this application, first is to run with the lready created image and pushed to docker hub
docker-compose up -da

Note : to build image use : docker build -t [repoName]:[tagname] .

To run this application directly from the code to generate fresh image, rename "docker-compose-with_build.yml" file run below command
docker-compose up -d --build

once this is deployed on docker 
we can run API : http://localhost:49162
Elastic Search : http://localhost:49161

# Creating cluster onto aws account
to run below command first you have to install eksctl application 
from https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/eksctl, it will install kubectl as well

eksctl create cluster --name [Cluster-Name] --region [RegionName] --nodegroup-name [NodeName: anyname you like] --node-type t3.micro --nodes 2

# Kubes commands
to create kube deployment file below command will generate yaml content which can be copied to yaml file for deployment

kubectl create deployment topic-search --image aryajasdev/topicsearch:v1 --dry-run=client --output yaml
kubectl create deployment elasticsearch --image docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.2.0  --dry-run=client --output yaml

## expose a deployment (defaults to type cluster ip)
kubectl expose deployment topic-search --port 80 --target-port 80 --type Loadbalancer --dry-run client --output yaml
kubectl expose deployment elasticsearch --port 9200 --target-port 9200 --type ClusterIp --dry-run client --output yaml

# Deploy
once above cluster will be created on your AWS Account run below command to depoy your containers to K8s
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

## Bash to access POD
kubectl exec -it [pod-name] -- bash

## Check the status of Pods
kubectl get pods

## check the servics
kubectl get svc

##check the deployments
kubectl get deployments
